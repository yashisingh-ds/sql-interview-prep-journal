# 📘 SQL Interview Prep Tracker — From Basics to Advanced Concepts

Welcome to my curated SQL preparation journey: a hands-on practice repository designed to **build strong foundational and practical SQL skills** required for entry-level **Data Analyst roles**.
This isn't just a set of random queries:  it's a **strategically structured, interview-aligned SQL practice log** that reflects my personal growth, problem-solving ability, and deep understanding of SQL through custom-built datasets.

## 💼 Why This Repository Exists

This journal-style repository is a personal initiative to:

- ✅ Demonstrate my structured learning from SQL basics to advanced topics
- 📂 Showcase hands-on preparation tailored for real interview scenarios
- 🚀 Reflect my commitment to becoming a data analyst who is both technically sound and job-ready

While others may also benefit, this project is primarily designed as **my own technical growth tracker** — a space where I have practiced over 600 curated SQL questions with real-world context.

So I created this project using a custom dataset with tables like:
- `employees`
- `departments`
- `salary`
- `attendance`

Each query is **interview-style**, built from **scratch**, and simulates real-time business cases from companies like Infosys, Accenture, Capgemini, TCS, Wipro, and more.

## 🧠 What's Covered (So Far)

> 📌 Practiced with 600+ structured questions (topic-wise, interview-based)

## 🧾 Sample Schema Overview

This repo uses a custom dataset that reflects HR and business use cases, with tables like:

- `employees` — employee details (ID, name, department, etc.)
- `departments` — department info
- `salaries` — bonus, CTC, remarks
- `attendance` — in-time, out-time, present/absent

## 👩‍💻 My Role: Self-Driven Analyst in Training

I designed, wrote, and structured every query with interview expectations in mind.

This is not copied from tutorials — it’s a result of:
- 📚 Daily structured practice
- 🧠 Breaking down company questions
- ✍️ Writing queries from my **own HR-style dataset**

## 📈 Outcome & Next Steps

✔️ Completed over **600+ SQL queries** across foundational to intermediate levels  
✔️ Built a solid base in real-world SQL logic — joins, filtering, grouping, and more  
✔️ Reinforced concepts through structured practice questions and personalized problem-solving  
🔜 **Next repository** will focus on:
- Window functions
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Subqueries
- Optimization patterns for technical interviews
